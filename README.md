# Asteroid-Game-Clone-WIP-
A game inspired by Asteroids. The name hasn't been chosen yet.


This is Blind00. This is a game that was insoired by Asteroids. I chose Asteroids because at the time, I was daydreaming about an ascii style game. The game was named ascii sector. I was also playing a bit of Asteroids. This Asteroid game clone, working on title, isn't actually an rpg like ascii sector, and I don't intend for the game to be an arcade game like Asteroids. I'm actually leaning on an RPG in space, with bullet hell mechanics. Also, I  like experimental games. I aspire to make games like Lucas Pope and have scripts good enough to be complimented by scriptwelder.
